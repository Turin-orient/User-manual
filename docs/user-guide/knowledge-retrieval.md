## How Knowledge Retrieval Works

Neurond Assistant has access to your company's **Knowledge Base** - a collection of:
- 📚 Company policies and procedures
- 📋 Employee handbooks
- 📝 Meeting notes and project documentation
- 📖 Training materials and guides
- 💼 Department-specific documentation

**Instead of searching folders**, just ask NA.

## Step-by-Step: Searching for Information

- What information do you need?

**2. Ask Neurond Assistant**
- Type your question in plain language
- Be specific about what you're looking for

**3. Review the Answer**
- NA searches relevant documents

## Example Questions

### Company Policies
```
"What is our remote work policy?"
"What are the guidelines for expense reimbursement?"
"Explain our data security policy"
```

### Procedures
```
"How do I request time off?"
"What is the process for submitting an IT ticket?"
"How do I order office supplies?"
```

### People and Contacts
```
"Who is the HR manager?"
"What is the IT help desk contact?"
"Who approves travel requests?"
```

### Benefits and HR
```
"What health insurance plans are available?"
"When do new employees become eligible for 401k?"
"What is our parental leave policy?"
```

## Understanding Source Citations

NA includes **sources** to show where answers come from:

**Example response:**
```
NA: "The deadline for annual reviews is March 31st.

Source: HR Policy Manual 2025, Section 4.2, Page 18"
```

**Why sources matter:**
- ✅ Verify accuracy
- ✅ Find original document if needed
- ✅ Check document date (is it current?)
- ✅ Confidence in the answer

## Advanced Knowledge Search

### Narrow Your Search

**By department:**
```
"What are the sales team's quarterly goals?"
```

**By time period:**
```
"What were the action items from last month's leadership meeting?"
```

**By document type:**
```
"Find the latest version of the employee handbook"
```

### Compare Information

```
"Compare our 2024 and 2025 vacation policies"
"What changed in the updated travel policy?"
```

---

## When Information Isn't Found

**NA says:** "I don't have information about that in my knowledge base."

**Possible reasons:**
1. Document wasn't added to the knowledge base
2. Using different terminology than in documents
3. Information is in a system NA doesn't have access to
4. Topic is outside loaded content

**What to do:**
- ✓ Rephrase your question
- ✓ Try related keywords
- ✓ Ask your supervisor or department
- ✓ Request admin to add relevant documents
