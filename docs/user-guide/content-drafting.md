## Best Practices

### ✅ DO:

**Provide context**
```
✅ Good: "Write to a customer who received damaged goods,  
          express apology, offer replacement or refund"
```

**Review before sending**
```
✅ Always read NA's draft
✅ Verify facts and numbers
✅ Ensure tone is appropriate
✅ Add personal touches if needed
```

**Iterate**
```
✅ Ask for revisions until it's right
✅ Refine tone and details
✅ You're in control of the final version
```

### ❌ DON'T:

**Send without reviewing**
```
❌ Always review AI-generated content before sending
```

**Include confidential specifics in prompts**
```
⚠️ Be general: "client discount" vs. specific numbers  
    if needed for privacy
```

**Rely solely on NA for critical communications**
```
⚠️ Use NA as a starting point, but apply your judgment
```
