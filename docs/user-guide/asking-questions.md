## Basic Principles

### 1. Be Specific

**❌ Vague:** "Tell me about policies"  
**✅ Specific:** "What is the expense reimbursement policy for domestic travel?"

### 2. Provide Context

**❌ No context:** "Write an email"  
**✅ With context:** "Write a professional email to IT requesting a new mouse because mine is broken"

### 3. Specify Format

**❌ Unclear:** "Give me the data"  
**✅ Clear format:** "Extract invoice data into a table with columns: Date, Vendor, Amount"

## Question Templates

```
"What is [topic]?"
"Explain [concept]"

```

```

## Advanced Prompting Tips

### Chain of Thought

Break complex requests into steps:

```
You: "I need to analyze these sales reports. First, summarize 
      the key metrics from each region."

NA: [Provides regional summaries]

You: "Now compare Q3 to Q4 performance"

NA: [Provides comparison]

You: "Based on this, what are the top 3 recommendations?"

NA: [Provides recommendations]
```

### Specify Output Format

**For structured data:**
```
"Create a table with these columns: Name, Department, Start Date"
```

**For lists:**
```
"Give me 5 bullet points about..."
```

**For specific length:**
```
"Summarize in 2-3 sentences"
"Provide a detailed explanation (200-300 words)"
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Too Vague
```
Bad: "Help me"
Better: "Help me draft a response to customer complaint about late delivery"
```

### ❌ Too Many Questions at Once
```
Bad: "Tell me about vacation, sick leave, benefits, and training policies"
Better: Ask one at a time, starting with "What is the vacation policy?"
```

### ❌ Assuming Knowledge NA Doesn't Have
```
Bad: "What did Sarah say in the meeting?" (unless notes were uploaded)
Better: "According to these meeting notes, what were the action items?"
```
