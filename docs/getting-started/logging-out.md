## Important Security Notes

### Why Logging Out Matters

:::warning Security Best Practice
**Always log out when:**
1. **Using shared computers** - Library, conference room, coworker's desk
2. **Public locations** - Coffee shops, airports, hotels
3. **Leaving your desk** - Even briefly in open office spaces
4. **End of workday** - Good security hygiene
:::

### What Logging Out Protects

Logging out prevents:
- ❌ Unauthorized access to your conversations
- ❌ Others viewing sensitive company information
- ❌ Accidental changes to your account
- ❌ Data exposure if computer is compromised

---

## Special Situations

### Session Timeout (Automatic Logout)

**What is it?**
After a period of inactivity, Neurond Assistant automatically logs you out for security.

**Typical timeout:** 30-60 minutes of no activity

**What happens:**
1. Warning appears: "Your session will expire in 5 minutes"
2. You can click "Stay Logged In" to continue
3. If you don't respond, you're logged out automatically
4. Your work is saved, but you need to log in again

:::tip Extend Your Session
If you're actively thinking or reading, move your mouse or click somewhere occasionally to keep your session active.

### Force Logout (Troubleshooting)

**When to use:**
If you're experiencing issues and normal logout isn't working.

**Steps:**
1. Clear your browser cookies for Neurond Assistant site
2. Close all browser windows completely
3. Reopen browser and navigate to login page

**Alternative:**
1. Close the browser tab
2. Open an incognito/private window
3. Navigate to Neurond Assistant URL
4. You'll need to log in fresh

### Logout from Multiple Devices

**If you're logged in on multiple devices:**
- Logging out on one device doesn't log you out of others
- Each device requires separate logout
- For security, logout from all devices individually

**To logout everywhere:**
Some systems offer "Logout from all devices" option:
1. Go to Settings → Security
2. Look for "Active Sessions"
3. Click "End all sessions" or "Logout everywhere"

- ❌ View conversation history

**You need to log back in to use Neurond Assistant again.**

### Your Data is Safe
