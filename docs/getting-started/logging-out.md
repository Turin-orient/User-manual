# How to Log Out Safely

When you are finished using Neurond Assistant for the day, it's a good idea to "lock the door" by logging out. This keeps your company's information safe and private.

---

## 🚪 1. How to Log Out

It only takes two clicks:
1. **Find your name:** Look at the top right corner of the screen where your profile photo or initials are.
2. **Click Log Out:** Click on your name, and a small menu will appear. Select **"Log Out"** at the bottom of that menu.

That's it! The "door" is now locked.

## 💡 2. Why Log Out?

- **Privacy:** It ensures that no one else can see your work if they use your computer after you.
- **Security:** It's a standard rule at most companies to keep information safe.
- **Fresh Start:** Logging out and logging back in tomorrow gives the system a "fresh start" and helps keep it running fast.

## 🕒 3. Automatic Log Out

Don't worry if you forget! To stay safe, the system will automatically log you out if you haven't touched your keyboard or mouse for a long time (usually about 1 hour). If you see a message saying **"Your session has expired,"** just log back in normally.
