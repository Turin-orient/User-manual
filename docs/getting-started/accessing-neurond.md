# How to open Neurond Assistant

Opening Neurond Assistant is as easy as opening your favorite website (like Google or Facebook). You don't need to install any special software!

Here is what you need to get started:

---

## 1. What you need
- **A Computer or Tablet:** Any computer that you use for work will do.
- **Internet:** You need to be connected to the internet (Wifi or cable).
- **A Web Browser:** We recommend using **Google Chrome** or **Microsoft Edge** for the best experience.

---

## 2. Where is the link?
Your company's IT team or your manager will provide you with a special website address (a "URL"). It usually looks something like this:
`https://assistant.yourcompany.com`

**Tip:** Once you open the link, click the little ⭐️ (star icon) in your browser's address bar to save it. This way, you can find it easily tomorrow!

## 3. What if it doesn't open?
If you click the link and see a blank screen or an error, try these simple fixes:
- **Refresh the page:** Click the reload button (the circle arrow ⟳) at the top of your browser.
- **Check your internet:** Try opening another website to see if your internet is working.
- **Ask for help:** If it still won't open, it might be a temporary hiccup. Give it 5 minutes and try again, or ask a coworker if it's working for them.

**Next step:** Once the page opens, you'll need to [Log In](logging-in.md). Let's see how!
