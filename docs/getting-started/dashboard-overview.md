# A Tour of Your Dashboard

Welcome to your new digital office! When you first log in, it might look a little empty, but don't worry—you'll soon fill it with helpful conversations and important documents.

Here is a quick tour of what you see on the screen:

---

## 🧭 1. The Main Area (The Center)

This is where all the talking happens!
- **The Chat Box:** At the bottom, you'll see a long box where you can type your questions.
- **The Assistant's Answers:** The assistant's replies will appear in the middle of the screen.

---

## 📜 2. The Conversation List (The Left Side)

The left side of your screen is like a "filing cabinet" for your talks.
- **Your History:** All your old conversations are saved here automatically.
- **New Chat:** Looking to start a fresh topic? Click the **"New Chat"** button at the top left.
- **Search History:** You can search through your old talks to find an answer you received last week!

---

## ⚙️ 3. Your Workspaces (Groups)

Think of a "Workspace" as a specialized room for a specific job.
- **Folders:** You can see different folders that contain the documents you've shared with the assistant.
- **Switching Rooms:** You can easily jump between different workspaces to work on different projects.

## 👤 4. Your Profile (Top Right)

This is your personal corner.
- **Settings:** Here you can change things like your profile photo or the way the app looks (like turning on "Dark Mode" if you prefer a black background).
- **Log Out:** When you're finished for the day, you can safely log out from here.

**Ready to try it?** Go ahead and ask the assistant your first question! If you're finished for now, let's learn how to [Log Out](logging-out.md) safely.
