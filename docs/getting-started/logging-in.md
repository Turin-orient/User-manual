# How to Log In

Logging in is like "opening the door" to your assistant's office. Once you're in, the assistant will remember who you are and save all your work for you.

---

## 1. Ways to Log In
Depending on how your company has set it up, you will see one of these options on the screen:

### Option A: Use your company account
- **How it works:** You click a button that says "Log in with Microsoft" or "Log in with Google."
- **What to do:** Just use the same email and password you use to check your emails every morning. It's fast and easy!

### Option B: Use a personal password
- **How it works:** You type in your company email and a special password for this app.
- **What to do:** If it's your first time, check your email for a "Welcome" message that contains your password.

## 2. First-time setup
The first time you log in, the assistant might ask you to:
- **Agree to the rules:** Just click "I Agree" to show that you'll use the tool for work.
- **Set up your profile:** You can add your name so the assistant knows how to address you.

## 3. Help! I can't get in
Don't worry, even the smartest people get locked out sometimes!
- **Did you misspell your email?** Check for typos (like `.con` instead of `.com`).
- **Is Caps Lock on?** Remember that passwords care if letters are BIG or small.
- **Forgot password?** Look for the "Forgot Password?" link on the screen to get a reset link sent to your email.
