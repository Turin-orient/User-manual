## 2. Login Methods

Depending on your organization's configuration, you can log in using the following methods:

This is the most common method. Simply click the "Login with Company Account" button (e.g., Google, Microsoft Azure AD). The system will automatically recognize you if you are already logged into that account in your browser.

### Method B: Email and Password
1. Enter your work **Email Address**.
2. Enter your provided **Password**.
3. Click the **Sign In** button to begin.

## 3. Security Considerations
*   Do not share your password with anyone.
*   Log out after completing your session if using a shared computer.
*   If you forget your password, please contact your IT support team for assistance.
