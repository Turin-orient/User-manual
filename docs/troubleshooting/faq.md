## 💡 General Questions

### What exactly is Neurond Assistant?
It's a smart office helper that helps you find information in company documents, write emails, and summarize long reports quickly.

### Is it hard to learn?
Not at all! If you can type a message in a chat app, you're already an expert.

### Is my information safe?
Yes. Everything you talk about stays inside our company's "private walls." No one outside the company can see your work.

## 📄 Working with Documents

### Can I send pictures to the assistant?
Yes! You can send photos of receipts, whiteboards, or scanned documents. The assistant can read the text inside them for you.

### What kind of files can I upload?
The assistant loves PDF, Word documents, and Excel sheets. It's like a speed-reader for all of them.

### How many files can I send at once?
You can send several files at a time, but try not to send 50 at once! It works best when you send a few related documents together.

### Can the assistant write for me?
It can certainly help! It can draft emails, write summaries, or even give you ideas for a presentation. Just remember to check its work before you send it—you are still the boss!

### Can it translate other languages?
Yes. If you receive a document in another language, just ask the assistant: "Can you explain this to me in English?"
