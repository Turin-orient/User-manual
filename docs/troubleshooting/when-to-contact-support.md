# When to ask for help

We've tried to make Neurond Assistant very easy to use, but sometimes you might run into a problem that you just can't fix by yourself. Don't worry—there's a whole team of people ready to help you!

---

## 🚩 1. When should you call for help?

You should reach out to the IT team or your manager if:
- **You can't log in:** You've tried your password multiple times and it's still not working.
- **The screen is broken:** You see a big, scary error message that won't go away.
- **Missing Information:** You know a certain document exists, but the assistant says it can't find it.
- **Wrong Answers:** The assistant keeps giving you answers that are dangerous or completely incorrect.

## 📝 2. What to do before you call

To help the support team fix your problem faster, try to gather these 3 things:

### Step 1: Take a "Picture" (Screenshot)
If you see an error on the screen, take a picture of it! 
- **On Windows:** Press the **Windows Key + Shift + S** to take a snippet.
- **On a phone:** Take a regular photo of the screen.

### Step 2: Remember what you did
Try to remember the exact steps you took before the problem happened.
- *"I uploaded a PDF, asked a question, and then the screen turned white."*

### Step 3: Check your internet
Make sure your computer is still connected to the internet. Sometimes the "problem" is just a loose cable or weak Wifi!
