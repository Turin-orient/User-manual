## Don't Contact Support For...

**Handle these yourself:**
- ❌ "NA gave wrong answer" → Rephrase question, regenerate
- ❌ "How do I use feature X?" → Check this user manual first
- ❌ "Upload failed once" → Retry, check common issues
- ❌ "Session expired" → Normal, just log back in
- ❌ "Slow during lunch hour" → Peak time, expected

**Still need guidance?** Ask a colleague or check documentation.
