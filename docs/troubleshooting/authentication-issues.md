# Help with Logging In

Sometimes "opening the door" to get into the app (logging in) can be a little tricky. Here is how to fix the most common issues so you can get back to work quickly.

## 1. I can't get into the app

### Typing the wrong password
- **What to do:**
  - Check if **Caps Lock** is turned on.
  - Try typing your password very slowly, one letter at a time.
  - If it still doesn't work, look for the "Forgot Password" button or ask your manager to help you get a new one.

### Trouble with your company account
- **What it means:** You are trying to use your normal work email to log in, but it's not working.
- **What to do:**
  - Close your browser completely and try opening the link again.
  - Try using a different browser (like switching from Chrome to Edge).
  - If it says "You don't have permission," ask your IT team if they have "invited" you to use the assistant yet.

### Your account is "Locked"
- **What it means:** You typed the wrong password too many times, and the system is keeping you out for safety.
- **What to do:** Just take a 15-30 minute break. The system will automatically "unlock" the door for you after a short wait!

## 2. Problems while using the app

### "Why do I keep getting kicked out?"
- **The Cause:** 
  1. You might have too many browser windows or tabs open at once.
  2. You haven't used the computer for a long time, and it "fell asleep."
- **What to do:** Don't use the "Back" button on your browser to log out. Just log back in normally. Don't worry—all your old conversations are still safe!

### "The screen says my 'Session Expired'"
- This is completely normal! To keep the company's information safe, the system will automatically log you out if you haven't been active for about 30-60 minutes. Just log back in and continue where you left off.
