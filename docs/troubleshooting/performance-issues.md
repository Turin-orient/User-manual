# Why is the app running slow?

Sometimes you might notice the assistant is taking a bit longer to answer, or the page itself is taking a while to load. Don't worry, it's usually a very simple fix! Here are a few things you can check.

---

## 1. For You (The User)

### The page won't load
- **The Cause:** Your internet might be weak, or your computer is trying to do too many things at once.
- **What to do:**
  1. Check if other websites (like Google or YouTube) are working normally.
  2. Close any extra browser tabs you aren't using.
  3. Close your browser and open it again.

### Waiting a long time for an answer
- **The Cause:** Your question might be very complex, you sent a giant file, or many people are using the assistant at the same time.
- **What to do:**
  1. **Split your question:** instead of one giant question, ask two or three smaller ones.
  2. **Use smaller files:** If your document is very heavy, try splitting it into smaller parts.
  3. **Be patient during "rush hour":** Just like traffic, the app can be slightly slower in the morning or right after lunch when everyone is logging in.

## 2. Best Browser Tips

To keep the assistant running fast and smooth:
- **Use a modern browser:** Make sure your **Google Chrome** or **Microsoft Edge** is up to date.
- **Turn off heavy apps:** If you are downloading a movie or in a big video meeting, your internet might slow down the assistant.
- **Fresh start:** Every now and then, restart your computer to clear out any digital "cobwebs."

## 3. When to tell the IT Team

You should tell the IT department if:
- The website won't load at all, even though your internet is fine.
- The assistant is **always** slow (taking several minutes for every answer) all day long.
- You see a message saying "The system is too busy" over and over again.

**Top Tip:** Starting your day with a fresh browser window helps your assistant stay "awake" and fast! 🚀
