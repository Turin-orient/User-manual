# Common Problems and Easy Solutions

Sometimes we all run into a little trouble with technology. Most of the time, the fix is very simple! Here are the most common problems and how you can fix them yourself in seconds.

## 🔑 Login Problems

**Problem:** "I typed my password, but the door won't open."
- **Solution:**
  1. Check if your **Caps Lock** is on (passwords care about BIG letters!).
  2. Make sure you didn't accidentally add a space at the end of your email.
  3. If you still can't get in, click **"Forgot Password"** to get a new one sent to your email.

## 🐌 The Assistant is Slow

**Problem:** "The assistant is taking forever to answer me."
- **Solution:**
  1. **Wait 10 seconds:** Sometimes the "brain" of the assistant is just busy reading a lot of documents.
  2. **Refresh the page:** Click the reload button (⟳) to give everything a fresh start.
  3. **Check your internet:** If your internet is weak, the assistant will be slow too.

## 📄 Upload Problems

**Problem:** "I tried to send a file, but it failed."
- **Solution:**
  1. **Check the size:** If the file is giant (like a whole book with hundreds of photos), try sending a smaller piece of it.
  2. **Check the format:** Make sure it's a normal file type like Word, PDF, or an image.
  3. **Try again:** Sometimes the internet just "hiccups." Try sending it one more time.

## ❓ The Answer is Wrong or Confusing

**Problem:** "I asked a question, but the answer doesn't make sense."
- **Solution:**
  1. **Ask in a different way:** Try using simpler words or giving more details.
  2. **Check the document:** Make sure the document you sent actually has the answer to your question.
  3. **Tell the assistant:** You can say, "That wasn't quite right, could you try again and be more specific?"
